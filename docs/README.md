## 🎯 Common Tasks

### Starting Development
1. Read [API Patterns](./development/API_PATTERNS.md) for coding standards
2. Review existing composables in `composables/` folder
3. Follow patterns when creating new features

### Adding a New Feature
1. **Plan**: Document in `features/` folder
2. **Backend**: Follow [API Patterns](./development/API_PATTERNS.md) → prevent N+1 queries
3. **Frontend**: Use composable patterns → cache-first, AbortController
4. **Test**: Verify no duplicate API calls, proper error handling

### Deploying to Production
1. Run through [Deployment Checklist](./deployment/DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md)
2. Verify all environment variables set
3. Test in staging environment first
4. Monitor post-deployment using Netlify logs

### Database Migration
1. Read [Migration Guide](./development/MIGRATION_GUIDE.md)
2. Backup database first (CRITICAL!)
3. Test migration in development
4. Document migration in `features/` if feature-specific

## 📖 Learning Path

### For New Developers
```
1. README.md (root) - Project overview
2. docs/development/API_PATTERNS.md - Core patterns ⭐
3. Browse composables/ folder - See patterns in action
4. Read feature docs in features/ - Understand implementation
```

### For AI/LLM Agents
```
1. docs/README.md - Navigation (this file)
2. docs/development/API_PATTERNS.md - Architecture patterns
3. Inline comments in code - References to docs
4. Feature docs for specific context
```

## 🔄 Documentation Standards

### When to Create New Documentation

**DO create documentation for:**
- ✅ New architectural patterns or conventions
- ✅ Feature implementation guides (>100 lines changed)
- ✅ Database migrations
- ✅ Infrastructure changes
- ✅ Security fixes or updates

**DON'T create documentation for:**
- ❌ Minor bug fixes
- ❌ Simple UI tweaks
- ❌ Self-explanatory code changes

### Where to Put Documentation

| Type | Location | Example |
|------|----------|---------|
| Patterns/Conventions | `development/` | API patterns, coding standards |
| Feature implementation | `features/` | Holdings refactoring guide |
| Deployment/Setup | `deployment/` | Clerk setup, Netlify config |
| Performance/Errors | `infrastructure/` | Optimization, error handling |

### Documentation Format
